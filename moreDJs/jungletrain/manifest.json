The trailhead for this journey is a deep halftime vibe that touches on some esoteric thinkin' music before launching headfirst into amen-laden jungle.\r\n\r\nThe subdued choppage provides a vibrant plateau of barely contained energy through the majority of the mix, painting a backdrop of a diverse tapestry that enshrouds the skyline that is our musical home. Concluding the the trek, our path winds down towards a cerebral multidimensional meditation guided by modern production techniques that fertilize the rhythmic soil for future generations to contemplate.\r\n\r\nWrapping up, Darkstar adds: \"My favorite moment in the mix has to be Aeon Four's Babylon into Rumbleton's Sound Family. The Maya Angelou 'Still I Rise' quotation fits so perfectly in the spacious dubwise breakdown, with the messages interleaving on multiple levels. Recognize and process the past to improve our collective future. One life, one love. Thanks for listening.\"\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy this summer's promomix, and if you do, make sure to check out Rinse & Repeat Radio every tuesday night from 17.00 - 19.00 PDT, 20.00 - 22.00 EDT, 01.00 - 03.00 BST, 02.00 - 04.00 CEST!\r\n\r\nWe're taking a short break this summer, see you back in September for the next promomix!
